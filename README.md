üçø Netflix Content Catalog Data Analysis :
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the 

Netflix content catalog (using the netflix1.csv dataset) to uncover key trends and inform strategic business decisions regarding content investment and geographical expansion.

üéØ Project Goals :
The primary objective was to dissect the platform's content strategy by focusing on five core areas:



Content Mix: Analyze the ratio and growth trends of Movies versus TV Shows.


Geographical Focus: Identify the top content-producing countries.


Content Growth: Visualize the expansion rate by titles added annually.


Genre Popularity: Determine the most prevalent genres in the catalog.


Movie Duration: Find the optimal/most common movie runtime.

üí° Key Findings Snapshot:
The analysis of the 8,790-title catalog yielded critical insights for stakeholders, which are translated into actionable recommendations:



Content Focus: Netflix remains primarily a movie platform (most of the total catalog). However, recent years signal an 

aggressive expansion phase with a decisive increase in titles added yearly, indicating a significant investment shift, particularly toward TV Shows.


Geographical Concentration: Content sourcing is highly concentrated. The 

United States and India are the indisputable leaders in content production, revealing a high reliance on these key markets.



Genre Trends: International TV Shows, Dramas, and Comedies are the core genres driving current audience engagement and content volume.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques:
The project leveraged a modern data analysis stack to perform data cleaning, deep exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and visualization:


Data Cleaning & Visualization: Power BI / Excel 


Data Querying & Aggregation: SQL 


Deep EDA & Forecasting: Python (Pandas)

üöÄ Strategic Recommendations:
Based on the analytical findings, the project concludes with strategic recommendations to optimize content spend and market reach:


Content Strategy: Recommend a target shift in the investment ratio (e.g., from 70/30 Movie/TV Show to 60/40) to capitalize on the success and audience retention of TV series.


Market Expansion: Suggest high-potential targets like Brazil, Turkey, or Mexico for original content co-production, diversifying away from over-reliance on the US and India.


Content Optimization: Advise on prioritizing investment in high-performing genres (like International TV Shows) and targeting a specific optimal movie runtime derived from the duration analysis.
