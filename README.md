Here is a structured overview of the Netflix Content Analysis Project based on the provided document.

Project Overview
This is a 

data analysis project focused on the Netflix content catalog (netflix1.csv). The project aims to provide valuable insights into content strategy, audience demographics, and production trends.


The core goal is to analyze the content catalog to uncover key trends in content type, production, and distribution over time. This analysis will ultimately provide 

strategic recommendations for content investment and geographical expansion. The final analysis dataset contains 

8,790 rows and 10 columns.


Tools and Techniques
The project uses a mix of tools for the complete data pipeline:


Power BI / Excel: Used for data cleaning, modeling, and creating the final Dashboard.


SQL: Used for querying and aggregating data.


Python (Pandas): Employed for Deeper Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and forecasting.

Process
The project is executed in three main phases:

1. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing 

The initial steps revealed a clean structure but required several transformations for effective analysis. Key cleaning actions include:


Handling Missing Values: Replacing 'Not Given' with 'Missing' in the director column and 'Unknown' in the country column.



Splitting Columns: Splitting multi-country entries (e.g., 'United States, Canada') to count each country individually.



Date Transformation: Converting date_added to datetime objects and extracting add_year and add_month for time-series analysis.




Duration Parsing: Splitting the duration column into Duration_Value (numeric) and Duration_Unit ('min' or 'Season').




Genre Expansion: Splitting the comma-separated listed_in (genre) entries into individual rows for genre-level analysis.


2. Data Analysis and Visualization 

The analysis focuses on five key areas to generate impactful visualizations:

Focus Area	Metric/Analysis	Insight Goal
Content Mix	Ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows and their trend over time.	
Understand the platform's primary content focus and recent changes.

Geographic Focus	Top 10 Content Producing Countries.	
Identify key markets for production and assess geographical diversity.

Content Growth	Number of Titles Added to Netflix by Year.	
Visualize the platform's expansion and growth rate.

Genre Popularity	Top 10 Most Popular Genres.	
Guide future investment in high-demand genres.

Movie Duration	Distribution of Movie Durations (in minutes).	
Find the optimal/most common movie runtime.

Executive Summary: Objective, Key Finding Snapshot, and Actionable Recommendations.


Data Overview: Description, Cleaning Summary, and Initial Observations.


Key Visualizations: Presentation of the 5 charts with captions.


Analytical Findings: Detailed discussion on Content Strategy, Geographical Concentration, Audience Segmentation (via Ratings), and Genre Deep Dive.


Strategic Recommendations: Business actions derived from the analysis, covering Content Focus, Market Expansion, Genre Investment, and Content Length Optimization.


Conclusion: Summarizing the achievement of the objective and confirming the primary findings.

Key Insights
The analysis confirmed several critical points about the Netflix catalog:


Content Focus: Netflix remains primarily a movie platform, with films constituting the majority of the total catalog.


Expansion Phase: The aggressive increase in titles added yearly, especially in recent years, signals a decisive expansion phase.


Geographical Concentration: Content sourcing is highly concentrated, with the United States and India serving as the indisputable production leaders.


Genre Popularity: The high prevalence of International TV Shows, Dramas, and Comedies highlights the core genres driving current audience engagement.

Strategic Recommendations
The analytical findings translate into specific business actions for content stakeholders:


Content Focus: Recommend a target ratio for future investment (e.g., shifting from a 70/30 Movie/TV Show ratio to 60/40) to capitalize on the success of TV series.


Market Expansion: Suggest specific countries (e.g., Brazil, Turkey, Mexico) as high-potential targets for original content co-production.


Genre Investment: Advise on prioritizing investment in high-performing genres like 'International TV Shows' or 'Documentaries' while exploring potential gaps in underrepresented categories.


Content Length Optimization: Based on the Movie Duration Histogram, recommend an ideal runtime for future movie acquisitions or productions.
